# Depression-Risk-classification-Using-ML
using machine learning to predict whether an individual is at an high risk of depression based on survey responses
I am using a dataset called PH9-Student Depression from medeley. I will do EDA, one, hot encoding, stratification, and use linear regression as my primary baseline
I will come up with a Machine Learning Pipeline that encompasses a lot of strategies to make this happen.
This is a work in progress and a learning process, so it will take some time
I will do my best to finish it in good time!
